This research focuses on finding the most effective models that promote detecting fake news using news headlines. As fake news can have serious consequences on the political stability and democracy of the countries. The dissemination of this news has become faster than ever because of the internet's ease and speed and more prominent social media audience. They are making it challenging to identify fake news from social media platforms manually. There is a correlation between peopleâ€™s emotions and the virality of fake news. One of the ways to detect this fake news is by, text mining using sentiment analysis. Henceforth, the sentiment polarity using a lexicon-based approach is calculated and will find out its role in fake news. In addition, the accuracy of Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine which are supervised Machine Learning models for their performance are compared in the detection of fake news in the Indian Fake New Detection dataset. As a result, the role of sentimental score in detecting fake news, and hyper tunning SVM model is the best model compared with the other supervised learning ML model, with an accuracy of 93 %.
